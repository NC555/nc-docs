## Interview Questions

### Question 1: GDPR and Privacy by Design

**Question:** Your company is about to launch a new global marketing analytics platform that processes customer data, including user behavior and personal details. As a security architect, how would you ensure the platform is compliant with GDPR, and how would you apply the principles of "Privacy by Design" from the very beginning?

### Expected Answer

A strong answer should cover both the regulatory requirements and the proactive, design-centric approach to privacy.

1.  **Acknowledge Core Principles:** The candidate should first mention the core principles of GDPR: lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality (security); and accountability.

2.  **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA):** The first practical step is to initiate and lead a DPIA. This involves:

    - **Identifying the Need:** Since the platform involves systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale and processes personal data, a DPIA is mandatory.
    - **Process:** Describe the steps: consulting with the Data Protection Officer (DPO), describing the processing operations, assessing the necessity and proportionality, and identifying and mitigating risks to data subjects' rights.
    - **Outcome:** The DPIA will produce a list of risks (e.g., unauthorized access, data leakage, purpose creep) and a corresponding set of required technical and organizational controls.

3.  **Applying Privacy by Design (PbD):** The candidate should provide concrete examples of how to embed privacy into the platform's architecture:

    - **Data Minimization:** Architect the system to collect only the absolute minimum data required for the stated marketing purpose. For example, instead of storing a full birthdate, store only the age range if that is sufficient.
    - **Pseudonymization &amp; Anonymization:** Implement technical measures to pseudonymize user identifiers at the point of ingestion. For analytics where individual identity is not needed, data should be fully anonymized.
    - **User Consent and Rights Management:** Design a clear and granular user consent dashboard. Build robust, automated APIs and internal workflows to handle data subject rights requests efficiently (e.g., Right to Access, Right to be Forgotten/Erasure, Data Portability).
    - **Secure Data Handling:** Specify end-to-end encryption for data in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (TDE for databases, server-side encryption for object storage). Implement strict access controls (RBAC) based on job function.
    - **Default Settings:** The platform's default settings should be the most privacy-friendly (e.g., data sharing opt-out by default).

4.  **Accountability and Governance:**
    - **Record of Processing Activities (RoPA):** Ensure a RoPA is maintained for all data processing activities on the platform.
    - **Breach Notification:** Establish a clear incident response plan that includes procedures for notifying the relevant supervisory authority and affected data subjects within the 72-hour GDPR timeframe.

### Question 2: Data Classification and Secure Destruction

**Question:** A financial services firm has a legacy data warehouse containing years of mixed-sensitivity data, including customer PII, transaction records, and generic market data. The firm wants to decommission the data warehouse. Describe the process you would follow to handle this, focusing on data classification, retention, and secure destruction.

### Expected Answer

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the full data lifecycle, from identification to secure disposal.

1.  **Phase 1: Discovery and Classification:**

    - **Policy First:** State that the first step is to ensure a clear Data Classification and Handling Policy exists. If not, one must be developed. This policy should define sensitivity levels (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted/PII).
    - **Automated and Manual Discovery:** Use automated data discovery tools to scan the data warehouse schemas and content to identify and tag sensitive data (e.g., patterns for credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc.). This must be supplemented with manual review by working with data owners and business analysts to validate the findings and classify data that automated tools might miss.
    - **Data Inventory:** The outcome is a comprehensive data inventory that maps every dataset to a classification level, its owner, and its regulatory requirements.

2.  **Phase 2: Retention and Archiving:**

    - **Consult Retention Policy:** Work with legal and compliance teams to apply the corporate Data Retention Policy to the inventoried data. Different data types will have different required retention periods (e.g., transaction records may need to be kept for 7 years, while old marketing data may be disposable).
    - **Identify Data for Archiving:** Data that must be retained for legal or regulatory reasons but is not needed for active operations should be identified for secure archiving.
    - **Secure Archiving Process:** Describe the process of migrating this data to a secure, low-cost archive solution (e.g., AWS Glacier Deep Archive, Azure Archive Storage). The data must be encrypted before being moved, and access to the archive must be severely restricted and logged.

3.  **Phase 3: Secure Data Destruction:**
    - **Identify Data for Deletion:** Any data that is not subject to retention holds and is no longer needed should be slated for destruction.
    - **Methodology Based on Media:** The method of destruction depends on the underlying infrastructure.
      - **If Cloud-Based:** Use cryptographic erasure (crypto-shredding). This involves destroying the encryption keys used to protect the data, rendering the underlying ciphertext unreadable. This is the standard cloud practice.
      - **If On-Premises Physical Servers:** For the physical hard drives, describe methods compliant with standards like NIST SP 800-88. This includes:
        - **Clear:** Using software or hardware commands to overwrite the media with new data.
        - **Purge:** Using techniques like degaussing (for magnetic media) to render data unrecoverable by laboratory techniques.
        - **Destroy:** Physical destruction through shredding, incineration, or pulverization for the highest level of security.
    - **Certificate of Destruction:** The process must be fully documented, and a Certificate of Destruction should be generated and signed off by the data owner and the individual performing the destruction. This serves as an audit trail for compliance.
