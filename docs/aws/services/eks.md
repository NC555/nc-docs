Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS. It simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using open-source Kubernetes, with ongoing support and updates from the broader community.

## Amazon EKS launch types

### Amazon EKS with Amazon EC2

This is best for enterprises needing full control over infrastructure. It offers deep customization of EC2 instances alongside Kubernetes scalabilityâ€”ideal for complex, large-scale workloads.

### Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate

This is great for teams wanting Kubernetes flexibility without managing servers. It combines Kubernetes power with serverless simplicity, helping to scale applications quickly across various use cases.
