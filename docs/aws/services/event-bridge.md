EventBridge is a serverless service that helps connect different parts of an application using events, helping to build scalable, event-driven systems. With EventBridge, you route events from sources like custom apps, AWS services, and third-party software to other applications. EventBridge simplifies the process of receiving, filtering, transforming, and delivering events, so you can quickly build reliable applications.
