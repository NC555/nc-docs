# EventBridge Vs SQS Vs SNS

Amazon EventBridge, SNS, and SQS are all AWS messaging and event services, but they serve different purposes and use cases

#### EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge is an event bus service designed for event-driven architectures. It acts as a central hub that receives events from various sources (AWS services, custom applications, SaaS providers) and routes them to multiple targets based on rules. **EventBridge is ideal for building loosely coupled, serverless applications where you need to react to events happening across your system.** It supports event filtering, transformation, and can integrate with over 90 AWS services as both sources and targets.

## SNS

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a pub/sub messaging service that delivers messages from publishers to subscribers. It's designed for fan-out scenarios where you want to send the same message to multiple recipients simultaneously. SNS supports various delivery protocols including email, SMS, HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, and SQS queues. **It's particularly useful for notifications, alerts, and broadcasting messages to multiple consumers.**

## Amazon SQS

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queuing service that provides reliable, scalable message queues for decoupling application components. SQS stores messages in queues until consumers retrieve and process them. **It's perfect for asynchronous processing, workload distribution, and ensuring messages aren't lost even if consumers are temporarily unavailable.** SQS offers both standard queues (best-effort ordering, at-least-once delivery) and FIFO queues (strict ordering, exactly-once processing).

## Comparsion EventBridge, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS

| Aspect                  | Amazon EventBridge                                       | Amazon SNS                                     | Amazon SQS                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Pattern**     | Event routing & filtering                                | Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)                    | Message queuing                                |
| **Main Use Case**       | Event-driven architectures, application integration      | Notifications, broadcasting, fan-out messaging | Asynchronous processing, workload distribution |
| **Message Flow**        | Many sources → Event bus → Many targets (based on rules) | Publisher → Topic → Multiple subscribers       | Producer → Queue → Consumer(s)                 |
| Opensource Alternatives | - **Apache Kafka** <br/>                                 | - **Apache Kafka** <br/>- **Redis Pub/Sub**    | - **Apache Kafka** <br/>- \***\*RabbitMQ\*\*** |

**Key Similarities:**

- All support encryption at rest and in transit
- All integrate with AWS IAM for access control
- All offer high availability and durability
- All support Cloud Watch monitoring and logging

**When to Use Each:**

- **EventBridge**: When you need sophisticated event routing between multiple services and applications
- **SNS**: When you need to notify multiple subscribers about the same event immediately
- **SQS**: When you need reliable message storage and processing with the ability to handle failures gracefully

**Common Architecture Pattern:** EventBridge receives events → triggers SNS for notifications → SNS delivers to SQS queues for background processing.
