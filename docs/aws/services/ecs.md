Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a scalable container orchestration service for running and managing containers on AWS, like Docker containers. Docker is a software platform for building, testing, and deploying applications quickly.

## Amazon ECS launch types

### Amazon ECS with Amazon EC2

Ideal for small-to-medium businesses that need full control over infrastructure. Suitable for custom applications requiring specific hardware or networking configurations, with the flexibility of Amazon EC2 and the simplicity of Amazon ECS.

### Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate

Perfect for startups or small teams building web applications with variable traffic. It's a serverless option—no server management required—so teams can focus on development while Amazon ECS handles scaling and orchestration.
