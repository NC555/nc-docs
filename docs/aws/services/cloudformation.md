CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.
With CloudFormation, you can define your infrastructure as code. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.
