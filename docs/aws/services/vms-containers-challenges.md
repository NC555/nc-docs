# VMs & Containers challenges

Containers provide a reliable way to package your application’s code and dependencies into a single, portable unit, making them ideal for workflows that require high security, reliability, and scalability.

## Containers and VMs

A container packages your application with everything it needs to run, so it works the same on any computer. This helps to move, update, and manage. Containers are faster and lighter than virtual machines (VMs) because they share the host computer’s operating system. VMs use a hypervisor to run full, separate operating systems, which makes them less resource-efficient and have longer startup times.

## Deployment consistency with containers

    When a developer’s environment differs from staging or production, deployments can fail and become difficult to debug. Containers solve this by keeping the application’s environment consistent everywhere, making deployments smoother and assisting troubleshooting.

## Scaling containers with orchestration

    As containerized applications scale, managing them becomes more complex. A setup that began with a few containers on a single host can quickly grow into hundreds or thousands of containers across multiple hosts. At that scale, manually handling container lifecycle, monitoring, and general operations becomes unsustainable. This is where orchestration tools come in. They automate deployment, scaling, and management to keep everything running smoothly.
