# Availability Zones

Availability Zones are distinct locations within a Region, each designed as an independent zone with its own power, networking, and connectivity.

<div class="aws__ImageCentered">

</div>
- Availability Zones maintain **high availability** and fault tolerance for applications.
- Each Availability Zones consists of one or more data centers.
