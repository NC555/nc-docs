# AWS CloudFront Edge Network Architecture

This architecture demonstrates how AWS CloudFront's global edge network reduces latency and enhances content delivery resilience for Government applications through strategic caching at multiple network tiers.

## CloudFront Edge Network Diagram

The diagram illustrates the content delivery flow from origin to end user through AWS's distributed edge infrastructure.

## Architecture Components

The content delivery architecture operates through a hierarchical caching system designed to minimize latency and improve user experience:

1. **Origin Infrastructure**:

   - **AWS GovCloud Region** hosts the primary application origin using services like S3 buckets or Elastic Load Balancers
   - Serves as the authoritative source for all content and application data

2. **Global Edge Network**:

   - **Regional Edge Cache (REC)** acts as an intermediate caching layer between edge locations and origin
   - **Edge Locations (Points of Presence)** provide the closest access point to end users worldwide
   - Creates a multi-tier caching hierarchy for optimal content distribution

3. **Content Delivery Flow**:
   - End users make HTTPS requests to the nearest edge location
   - On cache miss, edge locations query the Regional Edge Cache
   - If content is not cached regionally, requests proceed to the origin server
   - Content flows back through the hierarchy, being cached at each level

## Traffic Flow Process

The architecture follows a systematic approach to content delivery:

**Cache Miss Scenario**: User request → Edge Location → Regional Edge Cache → Origin Server → Content cached and delivered back through the hierarchy

**Cache Hit Scenario**: User request → Edge Location → Content served directly (lowest latency)

This design ensures that subsequent requests for the same content are served from the closest possible location, dramatically reducing response times and improving application performance for government users regardless of their geographic location.

## Benefits

The multi-tier caching approach provides enhanced resilience, reduced bandwidth costs at the origin, and consistent low-latency access to government applications across diverse user locations.
