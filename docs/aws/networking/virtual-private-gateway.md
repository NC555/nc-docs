Virtual Private Gateway is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.

With a virtual private gateway, you can establish a VPN connection between your VPC and a private network, such as an on-premises data center or internal corporate network. A virtual private gateway allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network.
