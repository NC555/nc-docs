A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, typically the internet. It essentially creates a private `"tunnel"` through which your data travels safely.

## Key purposes of VPNs

- **Security and Privacy :** VPNs encrypt your data, protecting it from hackers, especially on public Wi-Fi networks. Your internet service provider and websites can't easily see what you're doing online.

- **Remote Access :** Employees can securely access their company's internal network and resources from anywhere, as if they were physically in the office.

- **Bypassing Geographic Restrictions:** : VPNs can make it appear you're in a different country, allowing access to region-locked content or services.

- **Circumventing Censorship:** In countries with internet restrictions, VPNs can help access blocked websites and services.

## Types of VPNs:

- **Consumer VPNs -** Services like NordVPN, ExpressVPN for personal privacy
- **Corporate VPNs -** Company-provided access for remote workers
- **Site-to-Site VPNs -** Connecting entire networks (like branch offices to headquarters)
