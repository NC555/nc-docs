# 15 Types of Databases: A Comprehensive Guide

Databases are the foundation of modern software applications, each designed to solve specific data management challenges. This guide will walk you through 15 common database types, explaining when to use each one with practical examples and code snippets.

## 1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)

**What they are:** Databases that organize data into tables with rows and columns, using keys to establish relationships between tables.

**When to use them:**

- When you need structured data with clear relationships
- For applications requiring ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- When complex queries are needed

**Real-world examples:**

- Enterprise applications (HR systems, inventory management)
- E-commerce platforms (product catalogs, orders)
- Banking systems (accounts, transactions)

**Code example:**

```sql
-- Creating a simple table in SQL
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    signup_date DATE
);

-- Querying data
SELECT name, email
FROM customers
WHERE signup_date > '2024-01-01';
```

**Popular implementations:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server

## 2. Key-Value Stores

**What they are:** Simple NoSQL databases that store data as pairs of keys and values, similar to dictionaries in programming languages.

**When to use them:**

- For simple, schema-less data storage
- When you need extremely fast read/write operations
- For caching or session storage
- When your data doesn't have complex relationships

**Real-world examples:**

- User session storage
- Shopping carts
- Caching layers
- Real-time data processing

**Code example:**

```javascript
// Redis example (using Node.js client)
// Store a simple key-value
await redis.set("user:1001", "John Doe");

// Retrieve the value
const username = await redis.get("user:1001");

// Store a hash (nested values)
await redis.hset("user:1001:profile", {
  email: "john@example.com",
  age: 30,
  preferences: JSON.stringify({ theme: "dark" }),
});
```

**Popular implementations:** Redis, DynamoDB, Riak

## 3. Document Databases

**What they are:** NoSQL databases that store data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing nested structures without rigid schemas.

**When to use them:**

- When your data structure may evolve over time
- For semi-structured data
- When you need flexibility but still want to query based on document fields
- For content management or user profiles

**Real-world examples:**

- Content management systems
- E-commerce catalogs with varying attributes
- User profiles with different fields
- Mobile apps

**Code example:**

```javascript
// MongoDB example
// Inserting a document
db.products.insertOne({
  name: "Ergonomic Chair",
  price: 299.99,
  category: "Office",
  specs: {
    material: "Mesh",
    color: "Black",
    adjustable: true,
    dimensions: {
      height: "40 inches",
      width: "25 inches",
      depth: "23 inches",
    },
  },
  reviews: [
    { user: "user123", rating: 4.5, comment: "Very comfortable!" },
    { user: "user456", rating: 5, comment: "Best chair I've owned" },
  ],
});

// Query documents with complex criteria
db.products.find({
  price: { $lt: 300 },
  "specs.adjustable": true,
  "reviews.rating": { $gte: 4 },
});
```

**Popular implementations:** MongoDB, Couchbase, Amazon DocumentDB

## 4. Graph Databases

**What they are:** Databases designed to store interconnected data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).

**When to use them:**

- When relationships between data are as important as the data itself
- For highly connected data
- When you need to efficiently traverse relationships
- For recommendation engines, social networks, or fraud detection

**Real-world examples:**

- Social networks (friend connections)
- Recommendation engines
- Fraud detection systems
- Knowledge graphs

**Code example:**

```cypher
// Neo4j Cypher query language example
// Creating nodes and relationships
CREATE (john:Person {name: 'John', age: 30})
CREATE (mary:Person {name: 'Mary', age: 28})
CREATE (product1:Product {name: 'Smartphone X', price: 799})
CREATE (product2:Product {name: 'Laptop Pro', price: 1299})
CREATE (john)-[:FRIENDS_WITH {since: '2020'}]->(mary)
CREATE (john)-[:PURCHASED {date: '2024-01-15'}]->(product1)
CREATE (mary)-[:PURCHASED {date: '2024-02-20'}]->(product2)
CREATE (mary)-[:REVIEWED {rating: 5}]->(product1);

// Find friends of John who reviewed products he purchased
MATCH (john:Person {name: 'John'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(friend)-[:REVIEWED]->(product)<-[:PURCHASED]-(john)
RETURN friend.name, product.name;
```

## Choosing the Right Database

When selecting a database for your application, consider these factors:

1. **Data structure** - How structured or flexible is your data?
2. **Scale** - How much data will you store and how many users will access it?
3. **Query patterns** - What types of queries will be most common?
4. **Consistency requirements** - Do you need ACID guarantees?
5. **Development speed** - How quickly do you need to iterate on your data model?
6. **Operational complexity** - What is your team's expertise in managing different databases?

Remember that many modern applications use multiple database types together in a polyglot persistence architecture, leveraging the strengths of each for different aspects of the application.
