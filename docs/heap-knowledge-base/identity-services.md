# Identity Services

## Fundamentals of Identity Service Providers

Identity Service Providers (IdPs) form the backbone of modern authentication and authorization systems. They manage digital identities and provide secure user authentication across multiple applications and services. The core functions include:

- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity through various methods (passwords, MFA, biometrics)
- **Authorization**: Determining what resources authenticated users can access
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enabling users to authenticate once and access multiple systems
- **Federation**: Establishing trust between different identity domains
- **User Lifecycle Management**: Managing the creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts
- **Protocol Support**: Implementing standards like SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect
