## Installation Methods

There are several ways to install Ansible on Ubuntu 24.04. This guide covers the three most common methods:

## Basic Configuration

### Creating an Inventory File

Create a basic inventory file to define your managed hosts:

Add your hosts to the inventory file:

```ini
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[dbservers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
```

### Testing Ansible

Test Ansible with a simple ping command:
